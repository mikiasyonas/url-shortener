# Scalability Strategy for URL Shortener

## Current Architecture Capabilities

### 1. Performance Optimizations Implemented

**Database Layer:**
- Connection pooling (25-50 connections)
- Proper indexing on short_code and created_at
- Read replicas ready for horizontal scaling
- Query optimization with GORM

**Caching Layer:**
- Redis caching for 80-90% of redirect requests
- 1-hour TTL for cached URLs
- Connection pooling (100 connections)
- LRU eviction policy

**Application Layer:**
- Stateless application servers
- Goroutine-per-request model
- Connection reuse with Keep-Alive
- Efficient short code generation

**Infrastructure:**
- Load balancing with Nginx
- Horizontal scaling ready
- Health checks and graceful shutdown

### 2. Current Capacity Estimates

**With Single Server:**
- Redirects: 5,000-8,000 RPS (with Redis cache)
- URL Shortening: 500-1,000 RPS
- Memory: 512MB RAM
- CPU: 1-2 cores

**Target Capacity (10,000 RPS):**
- 4-8 application instances
- Redis Cluster for caching
- PostgreSQL read replicas
- Load balancer with SSL termination

### 3. Horizontal Scaling Plan

**Step 1: Multiple Application Instances**
```yaml
# Kubernetes deployment with 4 replicas
replicas: 4
resources:
  limits:
    memory: 512Mi
    cpu: 500m
